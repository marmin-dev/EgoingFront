            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> 
            <a>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</a>
            <a>As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</a>
            <a>All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</a>

        <a>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, </a>
        <a>functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</a>
